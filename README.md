## 📘 About the Project

**PyQuotex** was created as an open-source library to make communication with the Quotex platform via WebSockets easier. Over time, and due to misuse, a safer and more robust private version was created.

---

## 🎯 Library Goal

Provide tools for developers to integrate their systems with the Quotex platform, allowing automated operations in a safe and efficient way.

> ⚠️ This library **is not a trading bot** and does not make decisions on its own.
